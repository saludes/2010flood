\textbf{Problem statement}
??demanar opinio JQ??
During the raining season, rivers use to have a flow large enough to flood into the
nearby urban areas. To cope with this problem, some fields adjacent to the river basin are designated as
\emph{floodable}: At a cost, it is allowed to divert part of the flow into these fields by way of large gates which exist alongside the river. The area of the gate opening can be modified remotely.
One want to know the better control strategy for opening the gates, given the hydrologic profile
of the avenue which gathered upstream some hours before it reaches the control point.
