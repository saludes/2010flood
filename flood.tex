\textbf{Problem statement}
??demanar opinio JQ??
Under heavy rain, some rivers use to have a discharge large enough to flood into
nearby urban areas.
A way to cope with this problem is to designate some fields adjacent to the river as \emph{floodable}:
At a cost, it is allowed to divert part of the flow into these fields by way of large gates
which exist alongside the river. The area of the gate opening can be modified remotely.
One wants to know the best control strategy for opening the gates, given the hydrologic profile
of the flood which is gathered upstream some hours before it reaches the control point.
